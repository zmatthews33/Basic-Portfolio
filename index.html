    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>    
        From Memphis, TN, my roots are in the Delta. With a history so rich in music, it's no wonder I ended
        up learning the drums at an early age. I played in groups touring the country most of my teenage and early 
        adult life before pursuing many other interests. While I still produce music and play 
        on recording sessions, I have dabbled in woodworking and production design in the tv/film 
        industry and have most recently turned my professional focus to software and web development. 
    </p>
    <p>I am co-founder of a music software and hardware start-up here in Nashville that is focusing on the development and launch of a product called SynthTable.
       Essentially, the software turns any digital turntable into a synthesizer and any respective DJ into a musician.
