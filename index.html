                    <p>    
                    From Memphis, TN, my roots are in the Delta. With a history so rich in music, it's no wonder I ended
                    up learning the drums at an early age. I played in groups touring the country most of my teenage and early 
                    adult life before pursuing many other interests. While I still produce music and play 
                    on recording sessions, I have dabbled in woodworking and production design in the tv/film 
                    industry and have most recently turned my professional focus to software and web development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I am co-founder of a music software and hardware start-up here in Nashville that is focusing on the development and launch of a product called SynthTable.
                    Essentially, the software turns any digital turntable into a synthesizer and any respective DJ into a musician.
